# SitOnChair
Very basic website/workshop from Coder's Lab Course. Done early in my learning days.

This site is made purely in HTML and CSS (without preprocesors).
It is static, there is no mobile version (back then I didn't know how to create one).

However, there are some fireworks - there is a hover over menu, so sub menu appears (it's that crazy).

If I've done this page now, it would:
<ol>
    <li>Take much less time</li>
    <li>Look much better</li>
    <li>Be responsive</li>
</ol>

Well, anyway, it shows some progress, so I'm putting it here.
